## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- Custom CSS properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Google Fonts

### What I learned



color picker

slider for grid size

transform and transitions for buttons - clear used psuedo class active but others had to work with adding and removing classes in JavaScript

custom paintbrush cursor 32 X 32

responsive design

flexbox

grid

most challenging - working with hsl and rgb colors - wanted rainbow mode (based on Josh W. Cameau) to only change hue; but had to convert rgb to hsl for lighten and darken modes to only adjust lightness (could only get rgb with getComputedStyle() method)


### Continued development

The biggest challenge with this project was
